Software version of the [Amazon Dash Button][2] on the ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜ. Uses iBeacons
to determine the room you are in and contextually offers you to buy a product.
By utilizing the [Sphere.IO][3] and PayPal APIs on the phone, custom backend
code is not needed.

Note: Project built at [ecomhack 2015][1], so the code is a little bit horrible.

## Building

```bash
$ make pod
$ make all
```
